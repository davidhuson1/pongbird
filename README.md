## About Pongbird

Pongbird is the official Rentbird ping pong rankings web page. Our mission is to track all the ping pong matches in the Rentbird office, and the corresponding rankings, as accurately and reliably as possible. We believe in equal ping pong rights for all players of all levels. Using the ranking board, a player can determine a worthy and equally skilled opponent and prevent a losing streak (which could lead to anger issues).
The rankings are calculated using the [Elo rating](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elo_rating_system) system.

In addition, this project is used to help increase Laravel and Vue skills.
Therefore, no Laravel starter kits are used and the inclusion of external packages or components is kept to a bare minimum.
